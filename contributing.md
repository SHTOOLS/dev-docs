# Contributing

All are welcome to participate and report issues on
[GitHub](www.github.com/SHTOOLS/SHTOOLS).

If you would like to contribute to the development process, please follow these guidelines:

* The SHTOOLS repository consists primarily of the branches `master` and `develop`. `master` is used only for tagged releases, whereas `develop` is the main branch for development.

* All changes to the code base are made by *pull requests*. Start by forking the SHTOOLS repo into your GitHub account, and then clone that repo onto your local computer. Commit changes to your personal repo, and when you think that your changes are ready to be incorporated into the main code, make a pull request from your account on GitHub.

* All pull requests will be subjected to discussion. During this phase, you may be asked to make additional changes. When the lead developers are happy with the modifications, they will merge them into the `develop` branch.
